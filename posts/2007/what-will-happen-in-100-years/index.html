Anyone who attempts to do so, must be a genius or a fool, perhaps a little of both. Philipp Lenssen on Google Blogoscoped, observes how one of those is true. Here is a more detailed analysis.\nJohn Watkins, must have been quite a visionary considering the depth of his predictions and how much of it has come true.\nFive hundred Million people\nHe was right about that, but under-estimated the human ability and eagerness to reproduce (and migrate). Based on the US census 2000,Â the US now has over 300 million inhabitants (that is excluding all the people on H, L and BÂ Visas)\nThe American will be taller\nAccording to this website, the average height of the American male is somewhere between 160 to 180 cms. Now, since he hasn’t provided a figure, there is no way to validate this information.\nThere will be no C, X or Q\nHmm.. I did a few searches for words starting with C:\nfindtheword.info = 47831\nwordhut.com = 274 pages of 51 words each (13974)\nNeedless to say, these are just ones that start with one of the letters he mentions. It ain’t happening anytime soon.\nHot and Cold Air from Spigots\nA search for ‘home heating systems’ on google gave about 33 million results in 0.15 seconds. Thankfully, we are way ahead of what someone a hundred years ago could imagine, how we would heat ourselves.\nNo mosquitoes or flies\nNot much of a change there (although, if you are reading this, then you probably live in a place will lesser mosquitoes than 100 years back)\nOne thing, I bet he never, in his wildest dreams, would have conceived was that we will have patents for mosquito repellents\nReady-cooked meals\nWe have found a million ways to feed ourselves, and this includes fast-food, and packaged dinners and Martha Stewart’s. Sweet Success!\nNo foods will be exposed\nIn the US, maybe, but there are still quite a few places in the world, where this is not erradicated (hint: take a flight to India and visit Arcot Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu - also take life-insurance before you go (I can be your nominee - use the contact form for such purposes or tweet me.))\nCoal will not be used for heating or cooking\nWoot! Woot! Google, good for ye. You are trying to do what someone thought of 100 years back. Go tidal power.\nThere will be no street cars in our large cities\nYeah right.\nPhotographs will be telegraphed\n2 cheers here. We even went a step further and invented this thingy called the internet, and we actually have quite a few sites (about 100,000)Â out there helping us do this. (big business these days uh?)\nTrains @ 150 miles/hour\nSadly, the US has moved away from trains and on to air-traffic in the last 100 years. The fastest train as of 1999 - the Metroliner reaches a maximum commercial speed of 125 mph (slower by 25 mph, dang!). But, there are several fast trains out there, that go over 300 mph.\nAutomobiles will be cheaper than horses\nNo comment. (I am trying to negotiate a deal with a local honda dealer - P.s: You guys areÂ great!)\nEverybody will walk ten miles\nIt feels like it without a car.\nTo England in two days\nI found a very interesting site, that talks about planes, fuel efficiency and flight times between New York and London.\nFight Time is the time taken by different aircrafts to fly between New York and London. Interesting to see that only two of the above are currently operational -Â the Boeing 747 and the F-15 Eagle. With the other two retired, a human being will have to sit for over 7 hours in a sealed coffin to reach London.\nThere will be air-ships\nSee above picture or google “aircraft” or “planes”. (no link for you, lazy bum)\nAerial War ships and forts on wheels\nWe have the most unimaginative names for them, planes and tanks?! How cool is “forts on wheels”?!\nThere will be no wild animals\nWell, we are almost there. I guess in another 20 to 30 years we will surely achieve this goal/vision. (Do ya see me smiling at this one?!)\nMan will see around the world\nHe was talking about google’s sight-seeing man!\nTelephones around the world\nGrand opera will be telephoned\nHow children will be taught\nThe will not be taught. They will be hypnotized into zombies, roaming around the world pursuing pointless objectives. That’s what 100 years can do to the human race (I’m feeling itchy today)\nStore purchases by tubes\nVegetables grown by electricity\nOranges will grow in Philadelphia\nStrawberries as large as apples\nPeas as large as beets\nBlack, Blue and Green Roses\nWhat’s with the predictions about food and flowers?! We have delegated these activities to the faceless farmer. (I haven’t seen one in years). For all I know, the food that I eat is being grown in mars, and arrives on my table through a disruption in the sub-space continuum.\nFew drugs will be swallowed\nNada on this one. Sorry. We have invented so many more drugs that we humans continue to swallow pills at an incredible pace. We even have new patents on pill swallowing.\n","wordCount":"897","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://blog.shiv.me/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shivanand Velmurugan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2007/what-will-happen-in-100-years/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Reflections","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://blog.shiv.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://blog.shiv.me/ accesskey=h title="Reflections (Alt + H)">Reflections</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://blog.shiv.me/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=http://blog.shiv.me/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=http://blog.shiv.me/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://blog.shiv.me/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://shiv.me title=Home><span>Home</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://blog.shiv.me/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://blog.shiv.me/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What will happen in 100 years?</h1><div class=post-description>What will happen in 100 years?</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2007-11-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 30, 2007</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Shivanand Velmurugan&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/shiva/blog/tree/master/content/posts/2007/what-will-happen-in-100-years.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>That is a very difficult question to answer (which I don&rsquo;t answer anywhere in this post: go away).
