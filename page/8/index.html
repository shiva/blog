That doesn’t explain my silence on this blog, its but an excuse. A lot of things have been happening, both in my personal and professional life, and I’m not at liberty to talk about them. Those are for another day.
I have been writing code - for money, ie - for 9 years now. This obsession started a good 6 years before that. I don’t have much to show for it (most of it is copyrighted, or lost across several machines, that weren’t mine). One thing that hasn’t changed is the burning desire to get near some of my idols – gods even. When I was 15, I promised myself that I will strive to be at the same level as some of these people.

I said I wouldn’t. I said I will hold out for purely ethical reasons, but it is very hard to resist the iPad. The first impression in-store is simply – awesome. This of course is not a surprise and is something that one can expect from apple these days.
Warning: This is a long post ..
Here are some thoughts, after a day of use:
It’s fast. Much faster than the iPhone 3GS. This is good news for the upcoming iPhone. The battery lasts a really long time. It was around 80% and I used it for incessantly until it died 7/8 hours later. The a4 processor is at this point THE chip to kill for. If you have any samsung shares, I would dump them now, and load up on apple (although they are a tad pricy these days) iPhone apps are useless and look ugly on the iPad. Don’t bother synching any of them The keyboard is a lot more usable that I thought it would be. I’m typing this post at about 60-70% of my usual typing speed. (Only true if inclined at an proper angle – the perfect angle: the one you get with the iPad case). I missed the universal back button. I’ve been spoiled by the freedom-toting nexus one robot ;) Other small annoyances include URL copy pasting between apps, and how the app store lists apps. Exiting the app store every time I install an app is also mind-numbing. I know I can use a Mac and install all apps at one go, but I didn’t spend a 1000 dollars for workarounds. Although I could type very well, creating a blog post is not this device’s forte. For one, all the switching back and forth, is a nightmare, and there is simply no way to get the links to apps for instance from the ipad. Adding images is a pain as well (which is why this is a purely text-only post). It is really nice until you want to go beyond its function as a consumption device. Even a little, and it makes you want to get to a mac/pc in a hurry. Some apps are just stellar, that make it worthwhile go through the above mentioned niggles. I don’t feel any remorse at having bought it, but at the same time, I’m not floored by everything either. That is actually the strength of the device. It is the first time a computing device completely disappears and you interact with data. The experience depends on the app that you are using. Instapaper does a great job, so does the gmail web app.

A whole day has passed since I left my 20s. They say it is a big day. They say it is a dreaded day. It was neither. Just busy (which is good).
I chanced upon [Douglas Adams’ post][1] from 1999:
> 1. everything that’s already in the world when you’re born is just normal;
> 2. anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;
> 3. anything that gets invented after you’re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it’s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.
> Apply this list to movies, rock music, word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are.

Person 1: You know I’m beginning to believe that each time something hits us hard - there’s going to be a lovely gift - only thing you don’t see it right away. Takes years sometimes. If only people realise this everyone will want to have problems all the time!!

Thanks for the iPhone, Mr. Jobs. There is a new way to protest the iPhone. I don’t have to sign petitions anymore. I can now take my $500 elsewhere, for a slightly more open experience. I didn’t ask for much, but I don’t have to wait on your whim any longer (no offense meant to you personally, Mr Jobs).</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2010-03-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 16, 2010</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;1 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Shivanand Velmurugan</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label='post link to So long and thanks for the "jailed" iphone' href=http://blog.shiv.me/posts/2010/2010-03-16-so-long-and-thanks-for-the-jailed-iphone/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Vancouver 2010</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>flickr-72157623346252133–10-Small–:

Here’s a conversation that @Thomashawk started
Here’s the feed for that entry
Here’s the feed for the owner’s entries
Theoretically, one could build a service that aggregates only specific conversations (and keep them updated), or only a small group etc… No more reading data from a firehose!!
That is very nice.
P.S: also this could be a way to aggregate all your webservices into one super feed, that can then be posted elsewhere (comments and all!!)
