1. Of all the things that transpired in the last two weeks, [this judgement][1] by the Supreme Court in the US will perhaps be the most damanging in the long-term.
While the world's attention is focussed on the economic damage of the Trump tariffs, the pre-eminent court in the US just gave the authoritarians even more power
to act with impunity. At this point, why bother with laws? Why pretend like the courts matter? The [partian][2] [judges][4] who are fine [accepting bribes][3] now get to hand over
judicial power to the fascists.

> Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent, identified how much is at stake: “The implications of the government’s position” are “that not only noncitizens but also 
> United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress if judicial review is 
> denied unlawfully before removal. History is no stranger to such lawless regimes, but this nation’s system of laws is designed to prevent, not enable, their rise.”
