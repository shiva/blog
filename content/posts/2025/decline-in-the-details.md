# The Decline is in the Details

There’s something funny about decline. It rarely a collapse. It’s often a slow rot, a little less care, a little more friction..

You call a Grab from a mall in Singapore. The app knows which exit you're near, suggests a pickup spot you hadn’t even noticed, and by the time you reach it, your ride is waiting. Seamless. Human[^6][^9].

You call an Uber in Vancouver. The pin drops in the middle of the road. The driver calls. You wave at each other from different corners of Pacific Centre. And for some reason, you're the one apologizing[^1][^12].

That gap—between what could be and what we tolerate—is widening. And it’s not just rideshares. It’s banking, public infrastructure, day-to-day digital services. The systems we once built with pride are now managed like cost centers. What we used to craft, we now optimize. And you can feel it[^20].

## Rideshare: Grab vs. Uber

Grab understands space. It knows the difference between "the front of the mall" and "Exit D near the food court." It routes drivers to where people actually are, not just GPS coordinates on a 2D map[^14].

Uber used to delight. Now it often feels indifferent. Pickups are a mess in complex locations. The design hasn’t kept pace with reality, or maybe it’s just not worth fixing[^1][^12].

Grab still feels like it was made for people. Uber, increasingly, feels like it was made for stakeholders[^20].

## Banking: Interac vs. UPI

In India, UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has become the backbone of a cashless economy. Launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016, it enables real-time bank-to-bank transfers using only a phone number or virtual ID. It’s deeply integrated into every bank app, supports QR payments, and works 24/7 without fees[^13][^22].

In contrast, Canada’s Interac e-Transfer system—used by most banks including Scotiabank—still feels clunky. Transfers are limited, often delayed, and require email addresses or phone numbers. Some banks charge fees, and the experience varies depending on whether your recipient has auto-deposit enabled[^3][^5][^8].

The difference isn’t just UX polish—it’s infrastructural intent.

UPI has transformed India’s economy:
- It processed over ₹23.49 lakh crore (~$2.8 trillion USD) in October 2024 alone[^21].
- It’s driven financial inclusion by enabling digital payments for street vendors and rural users alike[^13][^22].
- It’s credited with reducing cash reliance and driving economic growth through frictionless payments[^23][^24].

Meanwhile, Canada still treats digital payments as an accessory, not a foundational layer.

## What This Signals

None of these experiences exist in isolation. They’re all symptoms of the same thing:

Some places are still building for people. Others are managing decline.

Grab, Singapore’s banking system, UPI—they’re not perfect. But they still feel *alive*. There’s evidence of care, iteration, pride.

Uber, Scotiabank, Interac—they feel like they’ve settled. Like the teams behind them know where the edges are and have chosen to stop pushing.

We often talk about decline in macro terms—geopolitics, economics, institutional trust. But it shows up first in the details. In the last 50 feet of UX. In the difference between “it works” and “someone made this better than it had to be.”

## We Choose Where to Care

Care is expensive. But not caring is more costly.

The question isn’t whether we can do better. The question is whether we still want to.
