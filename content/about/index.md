I am Shivanand. [Hacker][1](not [security][2], but the [programming][3] kind).[Avid][4] [Photographer][5]. Aspiring pianist. Moderate tennis player. 

At work, I am privileged to work with awesome teams. I help build infrastructure, compilers, tools, SDKs and applications for an operating system that runs on carrier-class routers. If you are interested in my work, and want to know more, have a look at my [resume][6].
